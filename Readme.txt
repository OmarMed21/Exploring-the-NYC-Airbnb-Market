Skills used in this Project :
  a.Data Manipulation 
  b.Working with Dates in Python [Simple way]
  c.Linking Data Frames and Merging them
  d.Importing different Types of Files
  e.Cleaning Data e.g.[duplicates,times,strings,..]
  
  
 We firstly import the Three Data sets we're gonna work with and convert 'em to Data frames [airbnb_price.csv,airbnb_room_type.xlsx,airbnb_last_review.tsv] and take a look before we apply anything to study our data well.
 Then, we began with cleaning the first DataFrame by changing the Numbers stored as strings to numeric as we need to use it in the Calculations later.
 Steps 3,4 are calculations of average costs and comparing prices
 Now, cleaning the Second Data Frame , need firstly to make all the strings lowercase to be able to count 'em without issues
 Then converting the Dates Column to real dates by Datetime package then some Merging between data.
